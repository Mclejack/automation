The automation project is a central source for all scripts related to Nutanix.

# Dependecies
I recommend to install the Nutanix automation VM (AVM) for an easy use. 
Found at https://github.com/Tfindelkind/DCI

or install golang from https://golang.org/ 
Don't forget to set "GOPATH"

Don't miss the three dots "..." at the end!
